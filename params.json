{"name":"Android-codegenerator-plugin-intellij","tagline":"Intellij Plugin for Android code generation.","body":"### Introduction\r\nAndroid Code Generator Plugin for Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA was created to accelerate the process of creating or developing Android applications. Every Activity needs to have XML layout, and Activity contains all the wiring up code like: \r\n- fields for all required Views\r\n- assigning fields to actual objects (**findViewById()** method)\r\n- wiring up listeners to buttons (**setOnClickListener()** method)\r\netc...\r\n\r\nInstead of writing this code, I would be great if this code could be generated automatically. \r\nThis way I come up with idea to have a plugin which does the code generation. I couldn't find such plugin so I decided to write it by myself. Luckily I was off project then, and I could spend some time on it. \r\nThis way I created the first version in 2011. In 2014 I decided to basically rewrite the plugin from the beginning, add tests and split it into two projects: \r\n- library (https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-library)\r\n- main project - this one, which contains reference to library project, and all Plugin Development Environment related code.\r\n\r\n### Install from JetBrains repository\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/plugin_install_400.gif)\r\n\r\n### Download and install\r\nAll available versions of plugin are in [releases](https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-plugin-intellij/releases). You can download zip file from [latest release](https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-plugin-intellij/releases/latest) and install it.\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/install_downloaded_400.gif)\r\n\r\n### How does it work\r\nPlugin is retrieving from xml files, data about all the views that contain **android:id** attribute. It collects informations about view's type and id. Based on the *type of object* and *id* plugin generates fields, assignment, imports and methods. For more informations go to [android-codegenerator-library](https://github.com/tmorcinek/android-codegenerator-library) project.\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\n#### Finding menu options\r\nFor all xml files that are either in **layout** or **menu** directories menu option **Generate Android Code** appears. You can invoke it from Project Explorer as well as from Editor.\r\n\r\n![Menu Options](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/menu_options.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Generating Activity with Menu \r\n\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/creating_of_activity_with_menu.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Modifying code to generate\r\n\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/modifying_generated_code.gif)\r\n\r\n#### Plugin settings in Preferences\r\n\r\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/86831510/intellij-plugin/preferences.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThere are several very useful features some of them are:\r\n* generating Activity Class code from layout\r\n* generating Fragment Class code from layout\r\n* generating Adapter Class code from item layout\r\n* generating Menu code from menu xml\r\n* creating files from code\r\n* preview screen with generated code that can be modified before creation of file\r\n* detection of project package\r\n* detection of source directories in project\r\n* settings in Preferences with editable template for each option: Activity, Fragment, Adapter, Menu\r\n\r\n### Plans for future\r\nImproving plugin usability.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe author is Tomasz Morcinek @tmorcinek.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any problems with the plugin, or want to help, please contact me: tomasz.morcinek@gmail.com and I will try to reply as soon as I can.
